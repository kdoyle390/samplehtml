    <h1 class="webtext-page-title">The Articles of Confederation: A First Attempt at Government</h1>
    <p class="webtext-page-instruction">On this page you’ll learn about the Articles of Confederation.</p>
    <p>Immediately after declaring independence, the <strong>Continental Congress</strong> began to consider proposals for structuring the new government. They agreed that America would be a <a class="showtip indexable" title="An alliance of sovereign states united for common objectives.">confederation </a>of independent states under a limited national government. While a central government was needed to unite the 13 colonies in common purpose, the people would choose their government officials and check the power of those holding political office. America would be a <a class="showtip" title="A form of goverment in which people elect representatives to act on their behalf.">republic</a>, with elected leader representing the interests of citizens in government. Although it vests governmental authority in the people, a republic is not the same as a <a class="showtip indexable" title="A form of government in which political power is held by the citizens.">democracy</a>, which requires citizens to act on their own behalf in a public forum. This distinction between a republic marked by <strong>representative democracy</strong> and a <strong>pure or direct democracy</strong> was important to the Founders. It was the subject of much debate, and the final republican form of government they chose was purposeful.</p>
    <p>The Founders envisioned American as a republic not only because of the sheer size of the territory that would fall under the umbrella of the central government, but also because they feared the possibility of mob rule. Memories of popular opposition to British occupation, particularly the events of the Boston Massacre and the Boston Tea Party, were still fresh in the minds of the Founders. They sought a middle ground between the arbitrary rule of a king and the mob mentality of pure democracy. The end result of their deliberations was a representative government rooted in the consent of the governed through regular elections.<br></p>
    <p >Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government would consist of a single legislative chamber in which each of the original 13 colonies (now called states) would have a single vote.Congress would have very limited powers. Each state, on the other hand, would retain supreme power within its borders. States could coin money, regulate commercial activities, engage in trade, provide for the defense of their citizens, and so on. Fearful that vesting power in a single executive would lead to tyranny, the Articles did not establish an executive branch of government. Further, the national government was not granted any power to control the actions of the states or to enforce congressional decisions. In this way, the Articles of Confederation created the opposite of British colonial rule--a weak central government. With no executive branch to carry out the laws and no established Power over the states, this government was nearly incapable of action.</p>
    <p>
    The Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation in November of 1777, but it took more than three-years for the document to be ratified, with the final state approving it in March of 1781. Part of the delay is attributable to the Articles’ requirement of unanimous consent for<a class="showtip indexable" title="Formal and legally binding approval.">ratification</a>. Regardless, the Articles soon proved ineffective, as the extremely limited power it gave to the central government left the country vulnerable to unpredictable economic forces and possible foreign invasion. This became painfullfy clear in the aftermath of the war, when patriots of the Revolution found themselves broke, indebted to the banks, and facing foreclosure on their farms. Daniel Shays, a Massachusetts farmer and Revolutionary War veteran, led an uprising in 1786 to prevent court-ordered foreclosures. Massachusetts pled for federal assistance to quell Shays’s Rebellion, and Congress tried to allocate money to establish a national army, but only one state (Virginia) supported the measure, leaving Massachusetts to fend for itself.
